# MATLAB Scripts & Simulink Models

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for simulating brake system sensor signals over time.
This folder contains Simulink models for animating and visualizing sensor data.

---

## Files:
- **BSP_v2_2.m** – Simulates temperature, pressure, vibration, and pad wear signals.
- **BSP_v3_2.m** – Generates a labeled dataset based on different brake conditions.

---

## Purpose:
- Create synthetic sensor data for normal and faulty braking conditions.
- Provide data for training and testing AI models.
- Animate and monitor simulated brake sensor outputs.
- Test integration between sensor data generation and AI-based fault prediction (future scope).

---

## Notes:
- Use "From Workspace" blocks to import data.
- Use Scope blocks to visualize temperature, pressure, vibration, and pad wear signals.
