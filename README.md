# Brake System Prognosis using Artificial Intelligence

An embedded and AI-based system developed to monitor the health of a vehicle's brake system in real-time using sensors, FreeRTOS, and machine learning techniques.  
This project predicts potential brake faults like overheating, pressure drop, vibration anomalies, and pad wear.

## Introduction

Brake failure can lead to catastrophic accidents. This project demonstrates how sensor data acquisition, embedded processing, and AI modeling can predict failures early and ensure safe operation.  
The system collects real-time data from multiple sensors, processes it via a microcontroller running FreeRTOS, and predicts faults using an ML model.
